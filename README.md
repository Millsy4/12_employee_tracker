This project was created to learn about interacting with MySQL databases using a node server, as well as to learn MySQL itself.  With this project you can create, update, and later remove employees, their roles, and the departments of your company (after I go back and implement it).

## **Installation**
  
To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:
  
*npm i*
  
## **Usage**
  
To use this program, you must have all the dependencies installed, which are located in the package.json.  After you have those installed, you must also have the database setup on your MySQL, so you should take the schema.sql file and copy and paste that into your MySQL.  After that, you should seed your MySQL with some starter information for at least the roles and departments tables, starting with the departments, then roles, then add employees after.  Once you've completed setting up your database, you should then come back to your index.js file, open it in an integrated terminal and run 'node index.js'.  This will then start the program and begin to prompt you through sets of questions depending on what you wish to update or add to your database.
